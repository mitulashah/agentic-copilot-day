# Implementation Plan for Spec
Implement the based on a specification document provided to you.

Before generating the implementation plan, be sure to review the project/proposal.md file to understand an overview of the project.

Create an implementation plan for the spec.

Rules: 
-Keep implementations simple, do not over architect 
-Do not generate real code yet, pseudocode is OK
-For each step in your plan, include the objective of the step, the steps to achieve that objective, and any necessary pseudocode.

After you create a plan for implementing the spec, your task is to systematically implement each step of the plan, one at a time.

The implementation plan is just a suggestion meant to provide a high-level overview of the objective. Use it to guide you, but you do not have to adhere to it strictly. Make sure to follow the given rules as you work along the lines of the plan.

## Documentation requirements:

File-level documentation explaining the purpose and scope
Component/function-level documentation detailing inputs, outputs, and behavior
Inline comments explaining complex logic or business rules
Type documentation for all interfaces and types
Notes about edge cases and error handling
Any assumptions or limitations

## Guidelines:

Implement exactly one step at a time
Ensure all code follows the project rules and technical specification
Include ALL necessary imports and dependencies
Write clean, well-documented code with appropriate error handling
Always provide COMPLETE file contents - never use ellipsis (...) or placeholder comments
Never skip any sections of any file - provide the entire file every time
Handle edge cases and add input validation where appropriate
